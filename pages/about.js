          <h2>My Journey</h2>
          
          <div className="career-section">
            <h3>üîß From Aircraft Mechanic to Software Engineer</h3>
            <p>
              My career began in the highly regulated world of aircraft maintenance, where precision isn't just important‚Äîit's literally a matter of life and death. Working on complex aircraft systems taught me invaluable lessons about:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Systematic problem-solving:</strong> Breaking down complex issues into manageable components</li>
              <li><strong>Attention to detail:</strong> Understanding that small oversights can have major consequences</li>
              <li><strong>Documentation and processes:</strong> Following precise procedures and maintaining detailed records</li>
              <li><strong>Safety-first mindset:</strong> Always considering the broader impact of technical decisions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              These principles have proven incredibly valuable in software development. The same systematic approach that kept aircraft safely airborne now helps me debug complex applications and architect reliable systems.

          <div className="transition-section">
            <h3>üíª The Transition to Technology</h3>
            <p>
              My fascination with technology and problem-solving naturally led me toward software development. What started as a personal interest in understanding how systems work evolved into a passion for building them.
            </p>
            <p>
              I discovered that many of the skills from my mechanical background‚Äîlogical thinking, troubleshooting, working with complex systems‚Äîtranslated beautifully to the world of code. The main difference? Software problems rarely require getting your hands dirty with grease!
