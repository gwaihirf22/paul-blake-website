### Bug #003 - Mobile drop down off center
**Status:** âœ… **RESOLVED**  
**Created:** Oct 1, 2025  
**Reporter:** Paul Blake  
**Environment:** IOS 26 Vivaldi, Safari  

**Description:**
Reading progress bar component fails to update in real-time during scrolling. The component can detect scroll position on component update/refresh but scroll event listeners are not firing properly during user scrolling.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Progress bar should update smoothly as user scrolls through blog posts
- Scroll events should trigger the progress calculation function
- Progress percentage should reflect current scroll position in real-time

**Actual Behavior:**
- Progress bar only updates when component re-renders (file changes, page refresh)
- Console shows "SCROLL EVENT FIRED!" never appears
- All scroll detection methods (`window.scrollY`, `document.documentElement.scrollTop`, etc.) remain at 0 during scrolling
- Vivaldi browser shows "Prohibited blocking overflowing/scrolling of the document" warning

**Technical Details:**
- Component: `components/ReadingProgress.js`
- Files affected: `pages/blog/[slug].js`, `pages/blog/theology/[slug].js`
- Current workaround: Polling every 100ms (not industry standard)

**Debugging Attempted:**
1. âœ… Multiple scroll event listeners (window, document, documentElement)
2. âœ… Different scroll position detection methods
3. âœ… Passive event listeners
4. âœ… RequestAnimationFrame for performance
5. âœ… Console logging to verify event firing
6. âœ… Polling approach (works but not optimal)

**Potential Causes:**
- CSS overflow/positioning issues preventing normal document scrolling
- Browser-specific scroll event blocking (Vivaldi interference)
- Next.js static generation affecting client-side scroll detection
- CSS layout preventing scrollable document height

**Current Workaround:**
Implemented polling-based solution that checks scroll position every 100ms. Functional but not performance-optimal.

**Next Steps:**
1. Investigate CSS layout for scroll-preventing rules
2. Test in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
3. Consider Intersection Observer API as alternative
4. Examine document structure and height calculations

**Priority Justification:**
Medium priority - feature works with polling workaround, but not following industry best practices. Should be resolved for performance and code quality.

## Resolved Bugs

### Bug #002 - Desktop Blog Dropdown Spacing and Edge Overflow âœ…
**Status:** âœ… **RESOLVED**  
**Created:** August 29, 2025  
**Resolved:** August 29, 2025  
**Reporter:** Paul Blake  
**Environment:** Multiple browsers, Next.js 14.2.32, macOS  

### Bug #001 - Reading Progress Bar Scroll Event Issue
**Status:** âœ… **RESOLVED**  
**Created:** July 27, 2025  
**Resolved:** July 29, 2025
**Reporter:** Paul Blake  
**Environment:** Vivaldi Browser, Next.js 14.2.5, macOS 24.5.0  

**Description:**
Desktop blog dropdown menu had incorrect spacing, padding, and would overflow past the viewport edge. styled-jsx component styles were being overridden by global CSS rules.

**Root Cause:**
styled-jsx specificity prevented component styles from taking effect consistently. CSS cascade and scoping issues caused desktop dropdown styles to be overridden at runtime.

**Solution:**
Added desktop override block in `styles/globals.css` to enforce dropdown padding, margins, and rounded corners. Ensured overflow clipping and slight left nudge off viewport edge.

**Files Changed:**
- `styles/globals.css`

### Bug #003 - Mobile Blog Submenu Expansion & Spacing âœ…
**Status:** âœ… **RESOLVED**  
**Created:** August 29, 2025  
**Resolved:** August 29, 2025  
**Reporter:** Paul Blake  
**Environment:** Mobile browsers, Next.js 14.2.32  

**Description:**
Mobile blog submenu had expansion issues, residual layout gaps, and conflicting hover/click behaviors. Submenu was present but non-visible with spacing problems.

**Root Cause:**
CSS cascade left the submenu present but non-visible with residual layout gap. Hover styles interfered on mobile, and mixed interaction models (hover + click) conflicted.

**Solution:**
- Switched to container-based show/hide (display/height/visibility toggled)
- Centered Blog link and removed legacy rules
- Disabled hover-open behavior on mobile
- Used container-level control instead of opacity-only

**Files Changed:**
- `components/Navbar.js` (mobile state toggle, CSS)
- `styles/globals.css` (desktop dropdown overrides)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Prefer container-level show/hide (display/height/overflow) over opacity/visibility only
- Keep desktop and mobile interaction models separate
- Use globals sparingly to resolve styled-JSX precedence issues

## Active Tasks

### Task #001 - Mobile Navbar Dropdown Enhancement
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ **PENDING**  
**Created:** August 29, 2025  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  

**Requirements:**
- Ensure Blog sub-links are hidden by default in mobile view and only shown when Blog is tapped
- Keep Blog aligned with other nav links; arrow rotates when expanded
- Center sub-link items; remove extra spacing
- Collapse again on second tap and on route change

**Notes:**
Related to resolved bugs #002 and #003. This is an enhancement task, not a bug fix.

## Development Notes

### August 29, 2025 - Navbar Dropdown Fixes

**Summary:** Comprehensive fix for navbar dropdown issues on both desktop and mobile platforms.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **CSS cascade & scoping**: Styled-JSX component styles lost to global anchor hover and other rules with higher precedence
2. **Mixed interaction models**: Hover and click behaviors conflicted on mobile
3. **Residual layout space**: Submenu container had space even when visually hidden

**Final Implementation:**
- **Desktop**: Kept hover interaction; enforced spacing/rounding with targeted override in `styles/globals.css`
- **Mobile**: Switched to container-based show/hide; disabled hover-open on mobile; centered Blog trigger

**Files Modified:**
- `components/Navbar.js` - Mobile state toggle and CSS
- `styles/globals.css` - Desktop dropdown overrides

**Best Practices Applied:**
- Container-level show/hide (display/height/overflow) over opacity/visibility only
- Separate desktop and mobile interaction models  
- Minimal global CSS overrides to resolve styled-JSX precedence
- Avoided unnecessary !important usage
