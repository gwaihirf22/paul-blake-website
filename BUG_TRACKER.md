### Bug #001 - Reading Progress Bar Scroll Event Issue
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**  
**Created:** January 27, 2025  
**Reporter:** Paul Blake  
**Environment:** Vivaldi Browser, Next.js 14.2.5, macOS 24.5.0  

**Description:**
Reading progress bar component fails to update in real-time during scrolling. The component can detect scroll position on component update/refresh but scroll event listeners are not firing properly during user scrolling.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Progress bar should update smoothly as user scrolls through blog posts
- Scroll events should trigger the progress calculation function
- Progress percentage should reflect current scroll position in real-time

**Actual Behavior:**
- Progress bar only updates when component re-renders (file changes, page refresh)
- Console shows "SCROLL EVENT FIRED!" never appears
- All scroll detection methods (`window.scrollY`, `document.documentElement.scrollTop`, etc.) remain at 0 during scrolling
- Vivaldi browser shows "Prohibited blocking overflowing/scrolling of the document" warning

**Technical Details:**
- Component: `components/ReadingProgress.js`
- Files affected: `pages/blog/[slug].js`, `pages/blog/theology/[slug].js`
- Current workaround: Polling every 100ms (not industry standard)

**Debugging Attempted:**
1. âœ… Multiple scroll event listeners (window, document, documentElement)
2. âœ… Different scroll position detection methods
3. âœ… Passive event listeners
4. âœ… RequestAnimationFrame for performance
5. âœ… Console logging to verify event firing
6. âœ… Polling approach (works but not optimal)

**Potential Causes:**
- CSS overflow/positioning issues preventing normal document scrolling
- Browser-specific scroll event blocking (Vivaldi interference)
- Next.js static generation affecting client-side scroll detection
- CSS layout preventing scrollable document height

**Current Workaround:**
Implemented polling-based solution that checks scroll position every 100ms. Functional but not performance-optimal.

**Next Steps:**
1. Investigate CSS layout for scroll-preventing rules
2. Test in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
3. Consider Intersection Observer API as alternative
4. Examine document structure and height calculations

**Priority Justification:**
Medium priority - feature works with polling workaround, but not following industry best practices. Should be resolved for performance and code quality.
