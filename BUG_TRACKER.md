### Bug #001 - Reading Progress Bar Scroll Event Issue
**Status:** üü° **MEDIUM**  
**Created:** January 27, 2025  
**Reporter:** Paul Blake  
**Environment:** Vivaldi Browser, Next.js 14.2.5, macOS 24.5.0  

**Description:**
Reading progress bar component fails to update in real-time during scrolling. The component can detect scroll position on component update/refresh but scroll event listeners are not firing properly during user scrolling.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Progress bar should update smoothly as user scrolls through blog posts
- Scroll events should trigger the progress calculation function
- Progress percentage should reflect current scroll position in real-time

**Actual Behavior:**
- Progress bar only updates when component re-renders (file changes, page refresh)
- Console shows "SCROLL EVENT FIRED!" never appears
- All scroll detection methods (`window.scrollY`, `document.documentElement.scrollTop`, etc.) remain at 0 during scrolling
- Vivaldi browser shows "Prohibited blocking overflowing/scrolling of the document" warning

**Technical Details:**
- Component: `components/ReadingProgress.js`
- Files affected: `pages/blog/[slug].js`, `pages/blog/theology/[slug].js`
- Current workaround: Polling every 100ms (not industry standard)

**Debugging Attempted:**
1. ‚úÖ Multiple scroll event listeners (window, document, documentElement)
2. ‚úÖ Different scroll position detection methods
3. ‚úÖ Passive event listeners
4. ‚úÖ RequestAnimationFrame for performance
5. ‚úÖ Console logging to verify event firing
6. ‚úÖ Polling approach (works but not optimal)

**Potential Causes:**
- CSS overflow/positioning issues preventing normal document scrolling
- Browser-specific scroll event blocking (Vivaldi interference)
- Next.js static generation affecting client-side scroll detection
- CSS layout preventing scrollable document height

**Current Workaround:**
Implemented polling-based solution that checks scroll position every 100ms. Functional but not performance-optimal.

**Next Steps:**
1. Investigate CSS layout for scroll-preventing rules
2. Test in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
3. Consider Intersection Observer API as alternative
4. Examine document structure and height calculations

**Priority Justification:**
Medium priority - feature works with polling workaround, but not following industry best practices. Should be resolved for performance and code quality.

## 2025-08-29

- Fixed: Desktop blog dropdown spacing and edge overflow
  - Cause: styled-jsx specificity prevented component styles from taking effect consistently.
  - Fix: Added desktop override block in styles/globals.css to enforce dropdown padding, margins, and rounded corners; ensured overflow clipping and slight left nudge off viewport edge.
  - Files: styles/globals.css

- Todo (mobile navbar dropdown)
  - Ensure Blog sub-links are hidden by default in mobile view and only shown when Blog is tapped.
  - Keep Blog aligned with other nav links; arrow rotates when expanded.
  - Center sub-link items; remove extra spacing.
  - Collapse again on second tap and on route change. 

- Fixed: Mobile Blog submenu expansion & spacing
  - Cause: CSS cascade left the submenu present but non-visible and a residual layout gap; hover styles also interfered on mobile.
  - Fix: Switched to container-based show/hide (display/height/visibility toggled) and centered Blog link; removed legacy rules and hover-open on mobile.
  - Files: components/Navbar.js (mobile state toggle, CSS), styles/globals.css (desktop dropdown overrides)

- Cleanup: Removed obsolete dropdown-* rules and consolidated mobile logic; kept a minimal, desktop-only override in globals to avoid styled-jsx precedence issues. Avoided unnecessary !important usage elsewhere. 

### Synopsis: Navbar Dropdown (Desktop + Mobile)

- Root causes:
  - CSS cascade & scoping: Styled‚ÄëJSX component styles lost to global anchor hover and other rules with higher precedence; desktop dropdown styles appeared but were overridden at runtime.
  - Mixed interaction models: Hover and click behaviors conflicted on mobile, leaving the submenu present but visually hidden and leaving layout gaps.
  - Residual layout space: The submenu container had space even when visually hidden (opacity/visibility without display/height control).

- Final approach:
  - Desktop: Kept hover interaction; enforced spacing/rounding with a small, targeted override in `styles/globals.css` (no scatter of !important elsewhere).
  - Mobile: Switched to container‚Äëbased show/hide (toggle display/height/visibility/overflow), disabled hover‚Äëopen on mobile, centered Blog trigger, tightened spacing, and used inline toggles only where needed (divider visibility).

- Lessons:
  - Prefer container‚Äëlevel show/hide (display/height/overflow) over only opacity/visibility to avoid ‚Äúghost‚Äù gaps.
  - Keep desktop and mobile interaction models separate; disable hover behaviors under mobile breakpoints.
  - Use globals sparingly to resolve styled‚ÄëJSX precedence when necessary; avoid broad !important rules that hinder future changes.
