I've been thinking lately about something that bothers me in our modern Christian culture. We're really good at pointing out the big, obvious sins—the wars, the genocides, the systemic injustices that make headlines. But we seem to have developed a curious blind spot when it comes to what we call our "little" sins. The private moments. The hidden struggles. The stuff nobody else sees.

We've bought into this fiction that sin is a personal matter. That what happens in the quiet corners of our hearts somehow stays there, affecting nobody but ourselves. It's convenient to think this way. Makes us feel better about the compromises we make when nobody's watching.

But here's the thing—it's complete nonsense.

## When Reality Fractures

Sin isn't just about breaking some abstract set of rules God arbitrarily decided on. Augustine got it right when he called it "amor sui usque ad contemptum Dei"—love of self to the contempt of God. It's a fundamental disordering of reality itself. And disordered reality doesn't stay contained any more than ripples stay at the point where you drop a stone in a pond.

<Callout type="info">
Sin always spreads. It's not a contained, personal matter—it's a fracture in reality that creates ripples far beyond what we can see or imagine.
</Callout>

I see this pattern everywhere in Scripture. Right from the beginning, actually. Adam and Eve ate some fruit—seems like a small thing, right? But look what happened immediately. Shame entered their marriage. Fear crept into their relationship with God. They started fighting with creation itself. Death became part of the human story. All from one "small" act of disobedience.

This isn't some ancient anomaly. Moses warned the Israelites that God "visits the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Him" (Exodus 20:5). Paul tells us that "sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned" (Romans 5:12).

The pattern is clear: sin spreads.

## The Cascade We Don't See

John Piper puts it this way: "sin always involves unbelief—that is, not trusting in God's grace and power and wisdom and goodness. Such distrust is the exact opposite of glorifying God." When we fail to trust God—even in ways that seem small—we set off a cascade of consequences we can't even track.

Think about the parent who harbors secret resentments. They might never voice these feelings, but kids pick up on that subtle coldness. The child grows up learning distorted lessons about love, forgiveness, and relationships. They carry those patterns forward, often without even realizing it.

Spurgeon described it perfectly: "Sin, like a tree, yields seed after its kind. A man cannot escape from the consequences of his own evil deeds." Today's private indulgence becomes tomorrow's ingrained character, which shapes the culture of the next generation.

Look at King Ahaziah in 2 Chronicles 22. His mother Athaliah "was his counselor in doing wickedly" (verse 3). The sins of one generation had literally become the guidance system for the next. The result? Destruction that affected an entire kingdom.

## The Weight We Can't Carry

C.S. Lewis paints this picture in "The Great Divorce" of a man who arrives in heaven with a small lizard on his shoulder. The lizard represents lust, and it keeps whispering that it's harmless, that it can be controlled, that nobody else is affected. But the truth is, this "small" sin has distorted the man's entire existence. It's only when the lizard is killed—a process the man initially resists because it's painful—that both he and the transformed lizard can truly live.

This hits me personally because I see the major ripples in my own life, all proceeding from what I once thought was just an untamed desire for self-gratification. You might say, "Paul, surely not all the pain in your life stems from this one sin." And to one degree you'd be correct. But I can't ignore how it affected things like my leadership in my home. I became like the strong man tied up while the thief of joy ransacked my house. Opening the door even a crack had profound consequences across multiple areas of my life. It was the avalanche that started with one unchecked rock.

<Callout type="warning">
We can't bear sin's weight. We were never designed to. Paul Tripp calls us "moral quadriplegics" when we're in sin's grip—unable to heal ourselves or undo the damage we cause.
</Callout>

Tim Keller captures the irony: "One of the great ironies of sin is that when human beings try to become more than human beings, to be as gods, they fall to become lower than human beings." In trying to define good and evil for ourselves, we diminish not only ourselves but everyone around us.

## Grace Changes the Game

But here's where the story gets beautiful. Into this cycle of destruction comes grace. The same Paul who diagnosed sin's universal spread also declares: "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Romans 8:1). Our salvation comes "by grace through faith... not a result of works, so that no one may boast" (Ephesians 2:8-9).

What makes this grace extraordinary isn't just that it forgives past sins. It introduces a completely new principle into the ripple effect. "If we confess our sins," John writes, "he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9). This cleansing carries the power to break generational cycles.

<Callout type="info">
Grace doesn't just forgive—it transforms. It introduces new ripples of healing, truth, and restoration that can break cycles of destruction.
</Callout>

Lewis describes this transformation in "Mere Christianity": "Every Christian is to become a little Christ. The whole purpose of becoming a Christian is simply nothing else." As we become more like Christ, our presence introduces new ripples—ripples of grace, truth, and healing—into our families, communities, and world.

## Moving Forward

So how do we actually deal with the subtle but pervasive consequences of sin in our lives? I'd suggest four practical steps:

**First, practice honest self-examination.** Lewis writes, "the first job each morning consists simply in shoving back all the thoughts, self-attitudes, feelings, resentments, and forgiveness that rush in upon waking. They have come before Christ was invited in for the day." We need to recognize our tendency toward self-justification.

**Second, embrace genuine confession**—not just to God, but when appropriate, to those affected by our actions. Jonathan Edwards reminds us that "true repentance is a turning, not from some sin, but from every sin."

**Third, receive grace fully.** Too many Christians stay trapped in self-condemnation despite believing intellectually in God's forgiveness. Augustine's insight remains relevant: "God loves each of us as if there were only one of us."

**Finally, participate in transformative community.** None of us can see all our blind spots or break entrenched patterns alone. Richard Sibbes puts it well: "We must with one eye look upon our sins, and with the other eye look upon God's mercy in Christ."

## The Greater Ripple

A friend recently compared the faith journey to climbing a mountain with switchbacks and cliffs. The key insight was that you're always just one step away from falling, no matter how high you've climbed. The higher you go, the greater the potential fall.

Guard your heart, reader. Seek intimacy with the one who made you. You can never climb so high that you're beyond the reach of the clay pit. But if that's where you find yourself, you can look to the one who was lifted up for all and begin again. "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life" (John 3:14-15).

The ripples of our rebellion may spread beyond our sight. But the ripples of God's redemption spread further still, reaching into the darkest corners with inextinguishable hope.
