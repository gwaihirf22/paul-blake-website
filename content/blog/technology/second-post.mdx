In this post, I'll walk through the technical decisions, architecture, and recent evolution of this blog platform.

## Current Tech Stack

This blog is built with a modern, security-focused stack:

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with static site generation and API routes
- **MDX** - Markdown with React component support for rich content
- **Docker** - Containerized deployment for consistency and scalability
- **GitHub Actions** - Comprehensive CI/CD with automated security scanning
- **Lighthouse CI** - Automated performance and accessibility monitoring
- **MailerLite API** - Newsletter subscription management
- **Giscus** - GitHub-powered commenting system
- **React Syntax Highlighter** - Enhanced code block rendering

## Why These Choices?

### Next.js with Pages Router

I went with the Pages Router over the newer App Router because it's mature, well-documented, and perfect for a blog use case. The static generation capabilities are exactly what I need for optimal performance.

### MDX Over Pure Markdown

While I could have used pure Markdown, MDX gives me the flexibility to embed React components directly in my posts when needed. This opens up possibilities for interactive content, code examples, and custom styling.

### Docker for Deployment

Containerizing the application makes deployment consistent across different environments. Whether I'm running this locally or on my server, Docker ensures it works the same way.

</CodeBlock>

This architecture separates content from code while providing a scalable foundation for both technical and theological content. The API routes enable newsletter subscriptions and automated notifications.

## Security & Performance Excellence
