# Styling and Images in MDX

Sometimes a blog post needs a bit of visual flair. MDX lets us mix Markdown with React components, so we can use Next.js's `Image` component to add responsive images with ease.

<Image src="/sample-image.png" alt="Sample MDX image" width={600} height={400} style={{ borderRadius: '8px', boxShadow: '0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)', width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />

The image above is generated locally for this demo. You can add custom styles directly with the `style` prop.

## Custom Styles

MDX also supports standard Markdown syntax. You can emphasize text, add lists, and include code blocks:

```css
.special-heading {
  color: #ff66cc;
  text-shadow: 2px 2px #000000;
}
```

And then use it in a heading:

<h2 className="special-heading">A Colorful Subheading</h2>

> MDX is flexible enough to let you combine the best of Markdown and React.
